                <p>The success of an app is when the users can easily navigate the interface. Users are impatient and don't like to be stressed. Hence, any digital product developed for them shouldn't make them think. It should come to them naturally.</p>
                <p>Engagement is the goal of UX design. It has nothing to do with a specific product, app, or website. It is concerned with what occurs before, during, and after human interaction.
                </p>
                <div class="product-use">
                    <p>A product can be said to have a good user experience design when it entails the following;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Useful</li>
                        <li>Usable</li>
                        <li>Enjoyable</li>
                        <li>Equitable</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><span class="product-entail">Useful:</span> It solves the user's problem intentionally.</p>
                    <p><span class="product-entail">Usable:</span> Here, the product design structure and purpose are clear and easy to use.</p>
                    <p><span class="product-entail">Enjoyable:</span> It means the product delights the user</p>
                    <p><span class="product-entail">Equitable:</span> It means it solves problems regardless of the differences, especially those in commonly disenfranchised groups.</p>
                    <p>The above are the characteristics of a product with a good user experience design.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, the Android app "Tv Mania" doesn't have a good user experience based on the reviews it got. The users do not enjoy the product, and a product that isn't enjoyable isn't useful.</p>

                <h3>WHAT WAS DONE WRONG</h3>
                <div class="wrong-list">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wrong choice of color. The mobile app color wasn't good enough to allow a user to make use of the app. Colors are very important when working on a digital product.
                            Some users are sensitive to colors, and others have color blindness. They should be considered when developing this app.
                            </li>
                        <li>The design lacks accessibility. Accessibility measures a user's ability to use products and services, as well as the extent and ease with which they can achieve their objectives. People with a variety of abilities and disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the web when it is designed with accessibility in mind.
                            <p>Due to a lack of accessibility, users can't interact with the mobile app. Navigation isn't easy to locate. Users complain about accessing the app as instructions are not given. Navigation is poorly done.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>The mobile app lacks a database management system (DBMS). A user complained about the inability to back up stats. In his words: <span class="italic">"I get what the creator of this app was going for and can overlook the design but they got it all wrong. What is the point of tracking TV shows if I cannot back up my stats?! I watch hours and hours of TV a week. If my phone dies I have to start from scratch- Definitely do not recommend." 
                        </span>
                        <p>The database management system is necessary to help store, retrieve, and manage data.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                        <li>The interface is clunky. An ugly or old-fashioned interface isn't appealing. It repels the users. A movie app should be appealing, as this will make the users come back to the app. A clunky design also means the design is non-responsive, that is, it cannot adapt to the given resolution and device size.
                            <p>Jess, one of the reviewers mentioned that <span class="italic">
                              "The user interface is clunky and there is no clear direction of what I should be doing"
                                </span></p>
                                <p>This could mean the application has a bad information architecture. The layout or strategic organisation of the mobile application that aims to help users easily adjust to the functionality of the product and find everything they need without much effort is referred to as information architecture.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Lack of asynchronous communication. Most users, if not all, have one or two devices which they use to access applications, and as such, they will want a sync of their activities on all devices. This is a problem pointed out by a user.
                            <p><spanclass="italic">"I'm looking forward to support the app developer. If they changed the bright colours and allowed a sync feature so I have the same stats on my tablet, the app would be much better."
                            </spanclass=></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Lack of visual cues A mobile application should have visual cues, especially for first-time use of the mobile application. Allowing keyboard access necessitates the use of visual cues. Fonts and buttons should be large enough to click with even a shaky hand.
                        </li>

                <h3><span class="accent-text">IMPROVEMENTS</span></h3>
                <p>To rectify the above errors, the developer should do the following:</p>
                <div class="improvement-list">
                    <ol>
                        <li><span class="d-block">Wrong Color Choice:</span>
                            To do this, the developer needs to make use of a Contrast Checker and make use of a better color that is not yellow and easy on the eyes.</li>
                        <li><span class="d-block">Inaccessibility:</span>
                            To do this, the developer should make use of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which ensure that the product is operable and understandable. This will solve the users' confusion on how to navigate or operate the mobi</li>
                        <li><span class="d-block">The mobile app lacks Database Management System (DBMS):
                        </span>The importance of a DBMS cannot be over-emphasized as it helps the users understand where their data is located. With the aid of a database management system, users can continue from where they stop if or when interrupted. They can also monitor TV shows. Using a database management system will solve this user's problem and make the mobile app enjoyable.
                    </li>
                        <li><span class="d-block">Clunky Interface:</span>To rectify this, the developer should look into using a flow chart. Write a set of rules which we call Pseudocode. All these are called algorithms.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="d-block">Asynchronous Communication:</span>The developer should look into asynchronous communication. This happens on the users' time and doesn't need scheduling. By so doing, the user will be able to see the same stat on any devices they use to access the application.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="d-block">Visual Cues:
                        </span>The developer should use a modal to make it possible to create visual cues. The cues will solve the users' confusion and tell them what to do.
                    </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Conclusion: </h4>
                    <p>The user experience of any application or software is important. They help designers and developers know how to build the right product that solves the users' problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>The developer must conduct research to fully understand what the users expect from such an app and avoid making assumptions.
